# Talking Code

## Instructions

1. For each question in [questions.md](questions.md), study the topic and challenge yourself to write your best answer. *Writing it is important*. There are few things more intellectually rigorous than trying to wrestle a concept into words. Don't just think it, don't just copy someone else's answer in, don't just rewrite your notes. Think through the question, and write your answer from memory in your own words.
1. Compare your answers to the [answers.md](answers.md) document. Make a note of concepts, cases, and subtleties you missed.
1. Focus your studying on the stuff you struggled with.
1. Make a new copy of the questions doc, and answer *all* the questions again.
1. Repeat this process until you are confident in your ability to answer them. This process will probably take many days. Don't try to cram; your long-term retention will be stronger if you spread out your reps.
1. Practice answering the questions *out loud* with another student. This is highly realistic interview prep. One of the most common interviewing issues is candidates not being able to verbally explain concepts they understand because they've never practiced before.
1. Answer the questions out loud with an instructor.
1. Congratulations, you can pass a technical screen!
